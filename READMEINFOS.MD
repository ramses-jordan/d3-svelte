# Assignment 3: Global Wind Power
*by Marinna Lorenz*

## Introduction
With the data provided by [Global Wind Power Tracker](https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-wind-power-tracker/). In this assignement the goal is to provide a an interface that makes understanding data about wind power energy production globaly accessible. The data is devided into different statuses (operating, developing) and there is an indication of the capacity in MW for each wind mills listed. As the original dataset is large we decided to reduce the visulization categorize the wind mills which are categorized in the status: operating for now.

## The end project
-The graph will be be linked to a map which will allow to compare the capacity in MW that countries provide as well as the comparaison in statuses between different coutries by clicking on the map.
